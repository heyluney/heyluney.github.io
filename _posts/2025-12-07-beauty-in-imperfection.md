I think there is beauty in things not always being perfect. Nature is imperfect. No leaf is perfectly symmetrical.

### Mass produced items are too perfect

I think this is why part of me doesn't particularly enjoy a lot of mass produced things, like plant pots. They are perfectly symmetrical, and often made of material that never naturally ages. They are uncannily perfect. Even when there is effort for a machine-made item to appear hand made, the output cannot truly give the feeling of something being crafted. 

### Superiority of handmade items

This is why I think handmade items are often superior (but more expensive in terms of cost, and often **very expensive** in terms of time, especially if you are the crafter and not very skilled at it...and may take many iterations to get right).
