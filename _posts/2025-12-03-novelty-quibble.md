### Novelty is overrated

Yes, I said it. Novelty is overrated. Newness or variety is pursued without thought. Take new release movies, for example. What is the price of admission, $20, $25? Even if there is a discount during the matinee, it's at least 4-5 times more expensive than just renting that same movie from Google or Amazon (or alternatively, watching an older movie at one of those dollar theatres).

### Holidays (also a form of novelty) is overrated

Every special occasion, businesses tend to show off their "limited edition" or "seasonal" offerings, especially in conjunction with big holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Go to any big box store and there are throngs and throngs of decorations (a lot of them cheap and disposal). Where do those things go? Don't they just get thrown away? Or alternatively, they are kept, stored in spaces unused for an entire year - taking up room, but providing no benefit. Moreover, this rapid consumption during this time of year yields enormous social pressure for everyone to do the same (human beings like reciprocation).

### Novelty (a release to boredom) exists in experiences too

I often think people pursue novelty when they get bored. Here's an example I often see at the climbing gym: people attempt a boulder once or twice - can't do a single move, and then move on.
