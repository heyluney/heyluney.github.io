### How much something is worth is how much it is used

A long time ago, I read somewhere that the true value of an article of clothing like a pair of jeans was the amount of times it got worn. So for example, if there are two pairs of jeans, one that cost $100 and another that cost $10, but you wear the first pair 100 times and the other one only ten, then the first one is actually cheaper per wear ($1 vs. $10).

It got me thinking that how much something is valued depends on how much it is used.

For example, for several years, we had a pair of outdoor chairs sitting in the balcony. They were never used. But what they did do was (A) look like an eyesore (I didn't like the style), (B) unnecessarily take up space and (C) prevent someone who could have used them from using them.
