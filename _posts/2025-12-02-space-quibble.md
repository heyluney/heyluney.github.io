### Why do people have so much space?

I'm beginning to come to an understanding of how much unused space there is in our society.

For example, take balconies. When you're strolling around an apartment complex - how many of those balconies seem to be occupied? Or for that matter, front porches? When you walk along a road and look at cars whizzing by, how many have not even the passenger seat occupied? It seems like if we reduced cars to one-person-sized vehicles, we'd quarter the amount of parking.


### Why are we in a no-walking equilibrium?

I was walking back from an errand today and I realized that even though the walk itself wasn't long (10 minutes in total), it **FELT** incredibly long. Why? Because there wasn't any interesting things to see along the way. There was a total of 4 highway clover ramps I had to cross (blood pressure inducing, especially as it seems like every person is in a rush). I saw the window sills of a hospital, which was depressingly filled with clutter and a few meagre looking plants. That's it. 

Nothing interesting to walk past, so the walk felt long (but plenty of stressors).

How much more enjoyable would it have been (and the walk would have felt much shorter too), if instead of walking along an extremely car-clogged road, I walked past a plethora of small businesses, all with outdoor seating?
