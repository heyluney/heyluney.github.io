This is just a general rant about all the things which I feel people buy which I personally find have close to zero value.

### No wedding rings

They are a rock. That's it. And they cost a fuckton. Thousands easily. Let's divert this money to the honeymoon. Take me to Europe instead? Or a michelin star experience?

### No destination wedding

Why are we making all of our loved ones shell out actual and inducing stress in their lives? Come to think of it, no dress code either. Why is there specifically a pressure for women to go out and buy a dress just for a wedding? Forget it. One other thing to take up unnecessary space in a wardrobe.

### No Cards

Why is a tree being killed just so we can see a message? Then it takes up clutter in some drawer and we feel guilty about throwing it away because of sentiment. This is an example of form over function. Why is it not socially acceptable to scrawl something on a napkin or a piece of used cardboard, if the message is almost certainly only going to be read once?

### No non-disposable gifts

A gift that is a long-term gift is a commitment. **AND** imposes an obligation - for sentimental reasons, there is psychological guilt with discarding said gift because it was purchased with you in mind. On two separate occasions, I've experience the gift giver give pants to recipients, neither of which fit very well (but given with good intention!). It seems like a gift card is suboptimal (it actually is suboptimal, compared to cash - although cash feels mercenary), but it reduces the amount of time for the giver and increases the amount of opportunities for the recipient. Rather than someone I care about spending money, I would much rather they spend their time.

### No nails, etc.

Just my own preference. No makeup for that matter either. No designer bags.

### No TV

If I need entertainment, why not use my computer, it's multi-functional? Or go to a movie theatre? Or go downtown and people watch? Plenty of books keep me company.
