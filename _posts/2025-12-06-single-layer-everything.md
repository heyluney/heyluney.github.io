I've recently discovered that it's better to put everything that's in the fridge in one single layer (nothing behind anything else). I do the same for the pantry. It leads to less forgetting whether you have something or not (expired leftovers, anyone?). Things that are out of sight are often forgotten. How often do you forget that you have an article of clothing when it's tucked in the far back of a closet, or relegated underneath piles of other clothes in the dresser? I think it's better to have fewer (and more treasured) belongings but too many.
