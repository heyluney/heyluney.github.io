Why don't people use their front porches?

I feel like people don't really use their front porches. I've walked across suburban towns, and almost all of them are empty (there's only one time I recall people using the chairs). It makes sense in colder weather, but it happens all the time! I think it's because people really don't want to sit outside in suburbia, when there's hardly any density of people? It feels like rather than people watching, you are the person being watched.
