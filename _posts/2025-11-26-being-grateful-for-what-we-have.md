### Humans want what they don't have

How often do we scroll throw an apartment on Zillow and sigh, wishing **if only** we lived there, our lives would be so much better if we lived here - it would be walkable to downtown, the floor plan is way more open, there are south facing windows, etc, etc.? Or scrolled online and seen a handbag, and immediately had to get it? Decided we needed a compost bin because of the design?
