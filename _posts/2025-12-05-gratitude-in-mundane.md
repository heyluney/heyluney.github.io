### Ordinary things can be fun

I think there is a tendency for chores to be onerous, something that we feel obligated to do. We don't look forward to doing them. We feel they eat up our time. That, if it weren't for things like getting our oil changed, going grocery shopping, or doing laundry, we could be doing more "fun" things.

### They are repetitive

Part of the issue I think is that we do these things on a continual basis - we repeat them over and over. It's most definitely **not** novel. 

### Things that are novel are exciting

Why are vacations so exciting? Often times it's because we've never been to that part of the world before. It's a brand new city. Brand new streets. Different food. Different Airbnb. Yes, we have a bed and sofa and kitchen at home, but at this stuff is all different.

### But does that mean that we can't find joy in the mundane?

I think that "normal" things can still be interesting. For example, take the same exact coffee shop. Every day, there can be different clientele. Or take the same neighborhood. Different groups of people can walk there at different times of day. Even standing at line in a grocery store, you might notice products that you've never seen before. You might notice there's something nice about the font style used in a jar of olive oil, for example. Or taken a look at a jar of artichoke hearts and thought about a dish you could create. 

### Reframing the mundane

I'll have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of washing dishes. Similar to brushing my teeth, I find the idea of scrubbing a bunch of stuff a little redundant and zone out and can't wait to get the chore done. I think of it as an obligation that I have to "get out of the way" before I can move on to the fun stuff. 

Recently, I bought a simple circular bamboo scrubbing brush. It fits delicately in my hand. The wood is smooth. the design is pleasing to look at. I enjoy using it. And, the side consequence is that I actually immensely enjoy washing the dishes a ton more. 

As for a different example - I found folding clothes to be a bit of a chore. After reading Marie Kondo's book, however, I reorganized one of my drawers (using shoeboxes as dividers for different types of garments) so that all the items were organized in exactly one horizontal layer, in compact rectangles. It is **very** beautiful to look at. In addition to the new organization method being aesthetically pleasing, I've made the act of folding more fun by playing whatever Taylor Swift song I'm obssessed with in the background.

Or take grocery shopping. One can think of it as a chore, especially if, like me, you walk to a grocery store and carry a bunch of stuff back (ughh). However, I can also reframe this as good cardiovascular exercise. The act of choosing ingredients and coming up with new recipes is fun. It is fun when you see new products at a grocery store. Or, to people watch.
