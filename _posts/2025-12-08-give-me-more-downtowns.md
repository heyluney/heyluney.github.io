Note: A lot of these are ideas are inspired by Jane Jacob's book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, and I share these sentiments completely.

### Suburbs are seas of monotony

I live in an area which is probably the land type that most Americans live in ... suburbia. We're talking four leaf clover ramps, endless throngs of cars in rush hour, huge parking lots outside stores, and roads and roads of residential homes. This is NOT the type of area that's nice to walk in. But it's the equilibrium that we live in... unless somehow people give up their automobiles and big single family homes.

### Give me more downtown-like areas

Why do so many people congregate in downtown areas? It's often not out of obligation, but because where people **want** to be. First - let's take the size of businesses. Often, businesses are a lot smaller than the big-box stores (think Walmart, Safeway, Best Buy, Target, Whole Foods, etc. - stores that require swathes of parking for their large clientele). This means that on a given block, more businesses (and more variety!) can be stacked. More variety means more clients coming and going for different reasons. And this leads to richer diversity of humans (like an ecosystem that supports differing flora and fauna). AND to top it off, the business fronts are right next to the side walk, as opposed to having an entire sea of parking blocking everything. This means more of -  curiously gazing into windows, reading restaurant menus, people watching, etc. - all very good for businesses!

### People enjoy people watching

It bears repeating that the more downtown-like an area is, the more variety of people go there - which in turn inspire more people to go there. And people find other people interesting. From the manner in which they dress (clothes and accessories), to how they talk and behave. 

### Cars are hidden out of sight

More places should restrict the mass amount of cars to parking structures - concentrated in small sections, but otherwise hidden out of sight. What's especially nice is the blocking of streets.
