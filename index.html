This is going to be a site full of random thoughts I have. Maybe will wax philosophical at times. Will rant at times. It will be a good way to practice writing. 

A bit about myself: I enjoy plants, coffee shops and bookstores. My ideal afternoon would be to sip on a lightly sweetened beverage, huddled in a nook at some cozy coffee shop (WHY DON'T MORE COFFEE SHOPS HAVE NOOKS?), surrounded by some hustle and bustle and a good book to sink my nose into.
